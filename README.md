# EQ3 Bluetooth Smart Thermostat

A modernized temporary replacement for the native Home Assistant component.

3. Addition will succeed immediately, so give the entity some minutes to connect to the thermostat

### Pairing issues

### Device entities

### Setting schedules

The internal schedules of the Auto mode can be set via a service.
Use *Devices* or *Areas* as target, not entities.

### Viewing schedules

There is a button to fetch the schedules from the thermostats. These are shown as attributes of that button.

### Setting Vacation Mode / Away Mode

There is a service to set up Away mode (vacation) with an end date/time, and target temperature.

Use *Devices* or *Areas* as target, not entities.

To easily set all thermostats to away you can combine it with an input timedate helper and a script and add them to lovelace like this:

### Device options

Most notably, you can select a specific bluetooth adapter, or limit to local ones.

### Differences with the original component:

- [x] It works in HA version > 2022.7
- [x] Support for BTProxy thanks to @ignisf (make sure you configure `active: true` in the BTProxy).
- [x] Supports auto discovery
- [x] Supports adding via config flow (UI)
- [x] Fixes setting operation mode
- [x] Allows to turn off by setting temp to 4.5°
- [x] Retries (10 times) when you change a thermostat attribute.
- ~~[x] Push instead of Pull. It updates on bluetooth advertisement instead of polling every x minutes (seems to generate less unsuccessful tries)~~
- [x] Connections are persistent (this may or may not reduce the battery life, but it makes the thermostats more responsive)
- [x] Fully uses asyncio (less resource intensive)
- [x] `Current Temperature` updates immediately, regardless of when the bluetooth connection is made. The component will apply the change as soon as it can connect with the device.
- [x] Service to fetch heating schedules and serial inside the thermostat
- [x] Only one concurrent request per thermostat
- [x] Service to set the heating schedules
- ~~[ ] Support for installing via yaml~~
- ~~[ ] Support pairing while adding entity~~
- [x] All features of the thermostat are exposed as entities
- [x] Bluetooth adapter, scan interval, etc are configurable.

### Previous Art

This is heavily based on https://github.com/rytilahti/python-eq3bt and https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/eq3btsmart and it should ideally be two PRs instead.
Unfortunately, the changes go too deep and remove support for the CLI and other backends.
Therefore, here's a self contained custom component instead.

## Environment Setup

We recommend using VS Code as IDE.

* Fork and clone the repository
* Install the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) dependency management tool and add it to your `PATH`
* Run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` to have `poetry` create the virtual environment inside the project directory
    > *This is recommended for compatibility with VS Code*
* Run `poetry install --no-root --with dev` to install dependencies and setup the virtual environment
* Install the recommended extensions in VS Code
* Select the Python interpreter to be `.venv/bin/python.exe` (Linux) or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows) in VS Code

Your environment should now be setup to contain all dev and non-dev dependencies and VS Code will automatically highlight and fix issues detected by `ruff` and `mypy`.
